## Hi there ðŸ––

I'm an undergraduate computer science student from Taiwan. My most familiar language is Python. I started to play CTF since early 2021, mainly focusing on web challenges, but I also like to solve some pwn and some pyjail/jsjail type challenges :p

I have a small blog written in Chinese [here](https://lebr0nli.github.io/blog/), it is mostly my CTF writeups and some notes.
